    description: "I design and build lovely internal web apps for researchers using Backbone, jQuery, HTML5/CSS3, and RESTful web services in ASP.NET and C#. I also create charts and presentation and proposal graphics, taking raw data and ideas and attempting to turn them into something meaningful. I also designed and manage vaxdesign.com.	The apps I write rescue the staff from manually managing processes in Word docs and Excel spreadsheets scattered across the network. My web and graphics work helped VaxDesign get acquired by Sanofi Pasteur in 2010 (a goal of the company then).		Examples of current work are at [toddlemoine.net][tl].	"
