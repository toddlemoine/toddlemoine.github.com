EXPERIENCE
=============================================================================

SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER
October 2015 to Present 
Jive Software in Portland, Oregon
http://jivesoftware.com

I'm helping create the foundation for Jive's next-generation UI, using React 
and node while maintaining parity with the legacy product. We are approaching 
this as an internal "open source" project, so some focus is given to support of 
remote teams, dissemination of best practices, and tests. 

SOFTWARE DEVELOPER IV
July 2012 to Oct 2015
Webtrends, Inc. in Portland, OR
http://webtrends.com

I built client-side analytics and web optimization applications and supporting 
APIs and middleware. These enterprise apps are scalable to thousands of users 
in different locales and are depended upon daily to make critical business 
decisions across various industries. Used mob programming to transition team to 
node + React + Flux + Immutable (away from Rails + Backbone). Helped create a 
"special snowflake" framework that ultimately didn't solve the problems it was 
intended to, but enabled some exceptional products.

MEDIA SPECIALIST
April 2005 to June 2012
Sanofi Pasteur VaxDesign Campus in Orlando, Florida
http://vaxdesign.com

I built modular internal web apps for researchers using Backbone, jQuery, 
HTML5/CSS3, and RESTful web services in ASP.NET and C#. I also created charts and 
graphics for presentations, proposals, and reports.  Designed and managed 
vaxdesign.com.

ENGLISH INSTRUCTOR
September 2003 to March 2005 
NOVA in Tokyo, Japan

I taught several 45-minute English sessions a day to all walks of Tokyoites, 
from 5 year-olds to Hiroshima survivors, each with different levels of fluency 
from almost none to nearly native.

VISUAL DESIGNER & WEB DEVELOPER
June 2001 to December 2002
Critical Content, LLC in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma

Critical Content was an attempt to start a web design shop in Oklahoma City 
dedicated to the idea that usability was a first-class consideration for any 
level of website. Together with a partner, I helped small businesses and 
organizations launch online presences, take baby steps into social media, and 
build brand identity.

INFORMATION ARCHITECT
May 2000 to June 2001
XOR Inc in Tulsa, Oklahoma

I helped clients determine their specific audiences for websites and those 
audiences' needs from the clients' sites, then design an information outline, 
structure, or flow for the sites.

WEBMASTER

Oklahoma State University Graduate College in Stillwater, Oklahoma
