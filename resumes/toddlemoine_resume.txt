EXPERIENCE
=============================================================================

SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
July 2012 to Present
Webtrends, Inc. in Portland, Oregon
http://webtrends.com

I contribute to a team of UI developers, building client-side analytics and web optimization
applications (including writing some supporting API middleware) and interactive visualizations
that help Webtrends' customers understand and act on their data. These enterprise apps are
scalable to thousands of users in different locales and are depended upon daily to make
critical business decisions across various industries.

Recently: Transitioned team to node + React + Flux + Immutable (away from Rails + Backbone).
Enjoying mob programming.

Notable: Lead front-end dev from prototype to shipping product of Webtrends' next-generation
ad-hoc analysis tool, Explore; I helped create an internal Javascript framework for rapidly
interating development using modular design patterns (good experience, but it was a "special
snowflake" framework and ultimately didn't solve the problems it wanted to); some light mentoring
of interns and team members.

MEDIA SPECIALIST
April 2005 to June 2012
Sanofi Pasteur VaxDesign Campus in Orlando, Florida
http://vaxdesign.com

I designed and built lovely, modular internal web apps for researchers using
Backbone, jQuery, HTML5/CSS3, and RESTful web services in ASP.NET and C#. I
also created charts and graphics for presentations, proposals, and reports, taking
raw data and ideas and attempting to turn them into something meaningful. I also
designed and managed vaxdesign.com.

ENGLISH INSTRUCTOR
September 2003 to March 2005
NOVA in Tokyo, Japan

I taught several 45-minute English sessions a day to all walks of Tokyoites,
from 5 year-olds to Hiroshima survivors, each with different levels of fluency
from almost none to nearly native.

VISUAL DESIGNER & WEB DEVELOPER
June 2001 to December 2002
Critical Content, LLC in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma

Critical Content was an attempt to start a web design shop in Oklahoma City
focused on building usable sites for its clients. We were dedicated to the
idea that usability was a first-class consideration for any level of website.
Together with a partner, I helped small businesses launch online presences,
take baby steps into social media (although we didn't recognize it at the
time), and build brand identity.

Highlight was creating branding and website for U21, an Oklahoma state
initiative to stop underage drinking.

INFORMATION ARCHITECT
May 2000 to June 2001
XOR Inc in Tulsa, Oklahoma

I helped clients determine their specific audiences for websites and those
audiences' needs from the clients' sites, then design an information outline,
structure, or flow for the sites.

WEBMASTER
1997-2000
Oklahoma State University Graduate College in Stillwater, Oklahoma

Designed and maintained the OSU Grad College website. Using Lotus Notes,
developed and implemented one of the few fully online graduate application
forms in the United States.
