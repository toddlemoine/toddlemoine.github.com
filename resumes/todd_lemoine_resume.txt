SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER (LEAD), Jama Software
----------------------------------------------
September 2016 - March 2020

I balanced technical and tactical responsibilities to deliver new React UI 
features and refactor legacy code for Jama’s suite of enterprise requirements 
and risk management apps. 

* Advocated for inclusive, accessibility-focused development with success 
  integrating WCAG AA-compliance into the larger Engineering culture;
* Delivered on-time, the first two significant epics of user-facing 
  improvements to a long-ignored area of the app in years;
* Built Risk Management Center, a spreadsheet-like app for helping organizations 
  in regulated industries conduct risk analyses, going from no code and 
  wireframes to a full-featured product in less than 12 months;
* Helped define direction and provided oversight of an offshore team’s project 
  to replace a fragile 3rd-party library with an in-house solution;
* Worked with the product owner, scrummaster, and external teams to keep a cross-
  functional team’s projects on-track and report up any changes or challenges;
* Helped Product and UX to define, groom, and write acceptance criteria for 
  stories;
* Mentored junior team members.


SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER, Jive Software
---------------------------------------
October 2015 - September 2016

I helped create the foundation for Jive’s next-generation UI, using React and 
Node.js to serve parts of the UI as a microservice while maintaining parity with 
and working alongside the legacy product.


SOFTWARE DEVELOPER IV, Webtrends
--------------------------------
July 2012 - October 2015

I built streaming client-side analytics and web A/B testing applications, and 
backend Rails APIs and middleware. 

* Transitioned apps to Node.js + React + Flux + Immutable (away from Rails + 
  Backbone). 
* Helped create a “special snowflake” framework that ultimately didn’t solve 
  the problems it was intended to, but enabled some exceptional products.


MEDIA SPECIALIST, Sanofi Pasteur
--------------------------------
April 2005 - June 2012

I built modular internal web apps for researchers using Backbone, jQuery, 
HTML5/CSS3, and RESTful web services in ASP.NET and C#. I also created charts 
and graphics for presentations, proposals, and reports. Designed and managed 
vaxdesign.com using Drupal and custom modules.

CURRENTLY

* Planning version 3 of slidewriter.io, a web app for creating slidedecks using 
  Markdown and built with React, MobX, and IndexedDB on the client, 
  experimenting with AWS Cognito, DynamoDB GraphQL, Lambda, and S3 
  on the backend.
* Using Python, Flask, and Postgres to create a web app for creating math and 
  language practice sheets for teachers and parents.
