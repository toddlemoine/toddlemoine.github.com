<h1 id="about">About Todd Lemoine</h1>
<p>
  I'm a conscientious developer who enjoys working on projects that help people. I live in Portland 
  with my wife and our two sons, and work as a senior software engineer at <a href="http://www.jamasoftware.com">Jama Software</a>,
  helping shepherd an app that helps organizations like SpaceX, NASA, Boeing and Caterpillar
  build their next-generation products. I'm focused on making the app more inclusive by 
  improving its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility">accessibility</a>.</p>

<p>I work mostly in Javascript, node, React, and the DOM, and I generally love it.  I believe the most 
  important attributes of an application are how empowered it makes users feel and how well it executes 
  on that promise. These days, I&#39;m interested in accessibility, RxJs, and functional programming.</p>

<p>You can see examples of my code in this <a href="/projects/tasks">ToDo application</a>, 
 or in this <a href="/war-react/">War card game</a>. Both were written as simple exercises, but should give you a feel for how I write and think. Source code is available 
 <a href="http://github.com/toddlemoine/tasks">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/toddlemoine/war-react">here</a>.
 </p>

<p>I also wrote <em>A Strange Game</em>, a book about my own take on modern life and 
  how to navigate it. You can buy it from <a href="https://leanpub.com/astrangegame">LeanPub</a> 
  or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Game-Preparation-rest-your-ebook/dp/B01CIEET5W">Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>My resume is available in <a href="/resumes/toddlemoine_resume.pdf" title="Download as PDF document">PDF</a>, <a href="/resumes/toddlemoine_resume.html" title="Download as a web page">HTML</a>, <a href="/resumes/toddlemoine_resume.mdown" title="Download as Markdown document">Markdown</a>, <a href="/resumes/toddlemoine_resume.txt" title="Download as plain text">text</a>, and <a href="/resumes/toddlemoine_resume.json" title="Download a JSON representation">JSON</a> formats.
