<h1 id="about">About Todd Lemoine</h1>
<p>
  I'm a conscientious, accessibility-focused full-stack developer who enjoys working on projects that help people. I live in Portland 
  with my wife and our two sons, and work as a senior software engineer. I'm currently looking for 
  a new team to join, having previously worked at Jama Software, Jive, and Webtrends.

</ul>

<p>I work mostly in Javascript, node, React, and the DOM, and I generally love it.  I believe the most 
  important attributes of an application are how empowered it makes users feel and how well it executes 
  on that promise. These days, I&#39;m interested in accessibility, RxJs, and functional programming.</p>

<p>You can see examples of my code in this <a href="/projects/tasks">ToDo application</a>, 
 or in this <a href="/war-react/">War card game</a>. Both were written as simple exercises, but should give you a feel for how I write and think. Source code is available 
 <a href="http://github.com/toddlemoine/tasks">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/toddlemoine/war-react">here</a>.
 </p>

<p>I also wrote <em>A Strange Game</em>, a book about my own take on modern life and 
  how to navigate it. You can buy it from <a href="https://leanpub.com/astrangegame">LeanPub</a> 
  or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Game-Preparation-rest-your-ebook/dp/B01CIEET5W">Amazon</a>.</p>
