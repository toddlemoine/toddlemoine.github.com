I'm a front-end developer at Webtrends in Portland, Oregon. I get my hands dirty in Javascript, Backbone, React, D3, and the DOM daily and I love it. I believe the most important attribute of an application is how empowered it makes users feel. Second most important is how well it executes on that promise. And I think code is craft.

{% highlight js %}

// foo() doesn't do much.

function foo(bar) {
    var a = 123;
    return 'it works!';
}

{% endhighlight %}
