# About Todd Lemoine

I live in Portland with my wife and our two sons, and work as a senior front-end developer at <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com">Jive</a>.
I work mostly in Javascript, node, React, and the DOM, and I generally love it. <em class="higlight">I'm a conscientious developer who wants to work on
something that helps people.</em> I believe the most important attributes of an application are how empowered it 
makes users feel and how well it executes on that promise. 

<em class="higlight">I wrote _A Strange Game_</em>, a book about my own take on modern life and how to navigate it. 
You can buy and download it from [ LeanPub ][asg_leanpub] or [ Amazon ][asg_amazon].

<em class="higlight">My résumé is available</em> in  [ PDF ](/resumes/toddlemoine_resume.pdf "Download as PDF document"), 
   [ HTML ](/resumes/toddlemoine_resume.html "Download as a web page"),
