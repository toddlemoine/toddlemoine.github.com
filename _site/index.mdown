        I live in Portland with my wife and our two sons, and work as a senior front-end developer at <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com">Jive</a>.
I work mostly in Javascript, node, React, and the DOM, and I generally love it. I'm a conscientious developer who wants to work on
something that helps people. I believe the most important attribute of an application is how empowered it 
makes users feel, with the second most important is how well it executes on that promise. 

I wrote _A Strange Game_, a book about my own take on modern life and how to navigate it. 
You can buy and download it from [ LeanPub ][asg_leanpub] or [ Amazon ][asg_amazon].
